## Getting started

1. `npm i` to install packages.
2. `npm run dev` to scan the html files for classes and build the CSS.
3. Click Go Live in the Status Bar of VSCode (requires [Five Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server))
4. `npm run build` to build for production (minifies css).

## Development set up

1. `public/css/style.css` is an auto-generated stylesheet. Use `public/css/tailwind.css` when making style changes. Ideally, inside the components or utilities layer.

2. The configuration for Fiver Server, such as port and default directory, is at .fiveserverrc.

### Notes

- no changes were made to the original redcoatsystems js files. I simply downloaded them.
- deleted formpop.css
- videos were downloaded
