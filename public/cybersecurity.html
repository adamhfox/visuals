                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>30-second Installation:</strong> Putting Webroot® to work
                    only takes 30 seconds. Plus, it is not going to conflict with any
                    other software you have running. So, regardless of any type of
                    updates, you need to perform, or if you ever have to install
                    Webroot® on an additional system, it can be done quickly and
                    efficiently, while also ensuring you and your business secure by
                    drastically limiting any type of unprotected downtime.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Automated Operation:</strong> When Webroot® was created, the
                    user was kept in mind. Each part of the software is simple and
                    intuitive. You can look through the templates that are already part
                    of the system or create one that is as unique as your business. You
                    never need a signature to manage your protection. Instead, the work
                    is done from the cloud so there is no impact on anyone’s experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Automated Updates:</strong> When you start using Webroot®,
                    you can set how often you want it to update. The updates are totally
                    transparent and take under five seconds in nearly all instances. You
                    will be alerted when an update takes place, so you can run a new
                    scan as soon as it is complete, should you so choose.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>It Can Be Managed Remotely:</strong> If you have an issue
                    with Webroot®, we can look at it from our location without having to
                    come to you to see what might be going on. It is set up with
                    administrators when it is implemented, allowing only those with the
                    proper codes and authorization to look at your system. All commands
                    that may need to be input to correct an issue can be done from
                    anywhere, so you never have to worry about trying to manage foreign
                    software. We centrally manage Webroot® for our clients using our
                    Datto Remote Management and Monitoring (RMM) Platform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Your Business Has Offline and Online Protection:</strong>
                    Webroot® anti-virus software is powerful enough to keep track of any
                    potential infection, even if that infection’s endpoint is no longer
                    online. This gives you several benefits, including receiving fewer
                    false alerts and the peace of mind that you will have reliable
                    protection from anywhere in the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Restoration is Simple:</strong> Since Webroot® anti-virus
                    and anti-malware protection is able to protect as well as safeguard
                    you both online and offline, you can restore any lost or corrupted
                    information back to your systems to a time prior to the infection in
                    a very small period of time. The best part is, that it can all be
                    done without the need for re-imaging your drive.
                </p>

                <h3>Understanding the Power of Webroot</h3>

                <p>
                    Webroot SecureAnywhere is an efficient anti-virus software that
                    focuses on security and speed. Its unique approach to detection and
                    monitoring allows it to perform scans with little to no performance
                    impact while maintaining one of the most robust databases of malware
                    out there. It does this by having a list of known safe applications
                    that can run immediately, and unknown applications are sent to their
                    threat detection center for review.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When taking a good look at various anti-virus and anti-malware
                    software solutions available for businesses today, you’ll see that
                    many don’t measure up to Webroot®. For example, Webroot® has a
                    built-in extension that can be applied to any web browser you wish.
                    At first glance, this might not seem like a big deal, as most other
                    popular anti-virus and anti-malware programs boast similar
                    extensions. However, the Webroot® extension can block dangerous or
                    suspicious website URLs before Google Chrome’s built-in protection,
                    which is a fact that very few protection software can boast about.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Webroot SecureAnywhere is also able to provide your business with
                    webcam protection, which is something that many other anti-virus
                    software programs do not provide. When you consider how much of your
                    business is conducted through video chat, it’s clear to see why this
                    has quickly become one of the most talked-about features.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The intelligence that powers Webroot® is world-class, and it has
                    been evolving for well over a decade. The entire system learns as
                    one unit and is able to update as a single unit as well. Each threat
                    that Webroot® encounters is classified and categorized so that it
                    can be studied and used as a learning tool to protect against future
                    mutations of the same type of threat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best way to understand how powerful Webroot is, is by looking at
                    how it works. It stores the definitions of threats that the entire
                    system has encountered. Each file is categorized as the type of
                    threat it was and where it came from. All of this information is
                    stored in the cloud rather than on the local PC. This dramatically
                    reduces the workload on the PC, making it feel lighter than most
                    other Anti-virus (AV) and anti-malware (AM) solutions on the market.
                    I’m sure we’ve all experienced our PC’s slowing down after the
                    install of an AV solution. One of Webroot’s big advantages is how
                    lightweight and fast it is while maintaining security. This is the
                    database in the cloud is what that Webroot learns from.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a new threat is categorized, and the location marked, the entire
                    Webroot AV system can update because the software is cloud-based.
                    This means that you and your company are never stuck with
                    out-of-date software and that you are always prepared for virtually
                    any type of attack. Whenever a new threat is located, an update to
                    protect against it is pushed out as soon as possible, allowing for
                    almost real-time protection against any type of online threat.
                </p>

                <h3>Benefits of Having a Security Software Online</h3>

                <p>
                    The sheer quantity of already-known data that covers current
                    phishing attempts, malware threats, and similar risks is enormous.
                    Having one database anywhere for all of this information would be
                    incredibly difficult, not to mention slow, to update. However, since
                    the information is all able to be stored online, this frees up space
                    and allows for near-instantaneous adjustments when necessary.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you were to try and keep all of this information in your
                    business, it would slow down your entire network. Every time your
                    company tried to run a scan, the network resources would be taxed to
                    the point of non-functionally. By having all the information in the
                    cloud, scans take seconds to minutes to complete and there is no
                    work stoppage during this phase of your security.
                </p>

                <h3>So Why Should You Choose Webroot?</h3>

                <p>
                    When considering what type of anti-virus and anti-malware program to
                    go with to protect your business, you may be asking why you should
                    choose Webroot as your option. This combination of endpoint
                    protection and DNS protection helps to keep your business safe at
                    all times. It was created and designed for small and medium
                    businesses and the Webroot console can be automated to provide
                    protection easily, so you can focus on growing your business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Webroot also has the experience you and your company can depend on.
                    They have been busy keeping the internet safe for over 20 years,
                    having first started back in 1997. They even went all-in on cloud
                    platforms in 2011. Their servers have been able to apply machine
                    learning through innovatively refining the cybersecurity processes
                    since 2007. No matter what type of security threats you or your
                    business may face, Webroot® has you covered.
                </p>

                <h3>The Security You Get with Webroot Protection</h3>

                <p>
                    Nearly everyone understands that using any type of computer carries
                    inherent risks. That is where the vitality of security comes from.
                    There are constant new sources of ransomware and dangerous software
                    coming at you regularly. It is not just from computers, either. It
                    can come from any type of device that has the ability to go online
                    and connect with a network. These threats are real and can do a lot
                    more damage than what may appear on the surface. When you rely on
                    Webroot AV and AM protection, you have a network of safety
                    surrounding every bit of information you hold dear. That, in and of
                    itself, can boost the value of your business.
                </p>

                <h3>Your Security Should Not Slow You Down</h3>

                <p>
                    Have you ever installed an anti-virus program that changed how your
                    entire network functioned during a scan, slowing it down to a crawl
                    and making getting anything done in a timely manner nearly
                    impossible? That will not be an issue when you install Webroot. This
                    system is incredibly light and not dependent on numerous resources.
                    That means when you run a scan, you and your customers will be able
                    to carry on like normal. This is possible because Webroot runs in
                    the cloud. You will barely notice that the program is around, other
                    than the fact that you will have fewer worries of phishing or key
                    logger issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Webroot servers are doing the vast majority of the work on their
                    end. That way, you can run a full scan without interrupting your
                    day. This means you get an easier Webroot installation, a smaller
                    footprint in your personal and business networks, boosted company
                    value and security, plus little, if any, slowdown. Your company has
                    nothing to lose, and a library of protection to gain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For those companies with older networks, servers, or devices, you
                    can get the benefits of Webroot AV and AM, too. The anti-virus
                    protection Webroot offers is not limited to use on only current
                    devices. It is compatible with many older devices, allowing you to
                    have the protection you need without the device upgrade bill you
                    don’t.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Where some anti-virus programs use a single tool to protect your
                    information, Webroot uses several. The goal is to provide smooth
                    protection of your IT infrastructure while keeping your servers of
                    information safe through remote monitoring. Both of these tools
                    provide an integration that allows them to work simultaneously. If
                    any type of threat, misconfiguration, or infection is detected, an
                    email alert is sent out so we can take immediate action. If we need
                    to reinstall Webroot or adjust a setting, it can be done remotely.
                    You have protection 24/7 without you even knowing that it is
                    happening or having to lift a finger to alert anyone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The integration of these tools allows us to have a quicker response
                    than most other antivirus programs on the market. This gives you
                    better service and allows you to have updated security promises you
                    can make to your customers.
                </p>

                <h3>We Also Install Webroot ChromeBrowser Extensions</h3>

                <p>
                    The list of websites that should not be trusted grows daily. The
                    same goes for the library of checked websites in the Webroot
                    directory. If you want to know what websites are safe and which are
                    not, you can include the Webroot Google Chrome add-on for your
                    <a href="https://answers.webroot.com/Webroot/ukp.aspx?pid=17&vw=1&app=vw&solutionid=1760">Browser
                        Extensions</a>
                    for Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. That way, you can see
                    which websites are safe before ever opening them. This keeps your
                    information away from even more potential threats, plus it blocks
                    unsafe sites from even being accessed by you or anyone else in your
                    network. You are getting the protection that goes beyond just you,
                    and also covers your customers and employees, too.
                </p>

                <h3>Visual Network Solutions Technology Group, Inc. Recommends Webroot Protection</h3>

                <p>
                    When looking at all the features Webroot can provide, it is no
                    wonder that we recommend this antivirus to many of our business
                    customers. Why not invest in something that can add value to your
                    business and give your customers peace of mind? You do not have to
                    worry that your network or resources will slow down while also
                    having constant protection both online and offline.

                <p>
                    It used to be that hackers would hide out in the basement and hope
                    to get lucky with a spam email or phishing attack. However, that is
                    no longer the case. Today’s cyber attackers are far more intuitive.
                    They know how to hit, when to hit, and what information to put in
                    front of you that makes you most likely to take the bait.
                    Thankfully, Webroot has spent over 20 years learning from the
                    mistakes of these attackers. It also knows what to look for, but it
                    has the intent of keeping you safe from an attack. Trust the
                    protection you get from a constantly evolving antivirus program like
                    Webroot. Know that you, your family, and your business’ information

                    Ninety-five percent of network security breaches are due to human
                    error. Empowering your team with the knowledge and skills to
                    identify cybersecurity threats is essential to keeping your network
                    protected. After all, a team of cybersecurity experts can only
                    protect your network so much; at a certain point, it’s up to your
                    everyday users to sidestep threats before they cripple your network.
                    That’s where cybersecurity awareness training, such as phishing
                    email training from Visual Network Solutions, comes into play.

                <p>
                    The first step to cultivating a culture of cybersecurity awareness
                    is simply to inform your team about the reality of cyber threats. As
                    new threats emerge, it’s critical to provide ongoing training that
                    helps employees spot threats and avoid them. Phishing email training
                    is one of the most straightforward ways of accomplishing this goal.
                    When you partner with Visual Network Solutions, it’s easy to ensure your team stays
                    one step ahead of cybercriminals by automating ongoing phishing
                    attacks.

                <p>
                    Phishing email training automatically sends team members simulated
                    phishing attacks on an ongoing basis. Your team will be able to
                    report the email as phishing or, if caught unaware, click on one of
                    the links. If they report the email, they’re congratulated and
                    notified that it was a simulated attack. If, however, they fall
                    victim to the simulated attack, they’re required to complete an
                    additional security awareness training course online to bolster
                    their awareness. Read more about
