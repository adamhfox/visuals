                    We have extensive experience in office relocation. Whether you’re
                    moving to a larger space in the same building or across town, we’re
                    here to make the move as painless as possible.
                </p>

                <h2>Have Seamless IT Support With Your Office Relocation</h2>

                <p>
                    Moving to a new location can be a significant source of stress for
                    many people, but it does not have to be. When you partner with
                    Visual Network Solutions Technology Group Inc. to provide IT support throughout your
                    office relocation, you can trust that your technology transition is
                    in good hands. Our current clients have called on us multiple times
                    because of how well their previous relocation went. A commercial
                    move is also a perfect opportunity for you to start your new
                    partnership with Visual Network Solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can design and structure your new services, help you move in, and
                    be there to maintain your technology in the coming years. One of the
                    most essential things to remember about the moving process for us is
                    that this is not just about moving things like office furniture or
                    file cabinets. You can hire a moving company for that. Instead, it’s
                    about moving your IT network, getting everything set up again, and
                    making certain that your technology is back in place as quickly as
                    possible. We know that for every day your team is unable to access
                    all of your files and applications is a day where you’re not as
                    productive as you should be. You’re losing profits every day you
                    work like this. That’s why commercial office relocation is a process
                    that takes planning and precise execution to complete properly.
                </p>

                <h2>Do I Need IT Support During A Relocation?</h2>

                <p>
                    Moving your business isn’t something you want to do on a whim or
                    without fully thinking it through. There are a number of reasons a
                    relocation could be a bad idea, no matter how near or far. However,
                    there are many reasons why relocating may make perfect sense for
                    your company at this time. Knowing when it’s the latter instead of
                    the former is one of the things that makes a great business leader.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The biggest reason companies relocate is because they’ve outgrown
                    their current office space. You may find that you need to hire more
                    employees but don’t have offices for them. You may be out of room to
                    store products or for new equipment you need to work more
                    efficiently. Another reason is that it’s time to upgrade. If you’re
                    still in the building where you started your business, it may no
                    longer be the perfect fit for you. There can be a number of reasons
                    why this is the case, but the main issue is that it’s time to move
                    to a building that meets your new needs, not the needs you had when
                    you first started your business.
                </p>

                <h2>IT Issues to Consider When Relocating</h2>

                <p>
                    When you’re moving into a new office, you want your new space to be
                    ready to handle all of your IT needs. We will assist you with all of
                    your IT considerations so that your new space meets your current and
                    future technology needs.

                    <strong>Cabling –</strong> If you have a good number of computers
                    and other devices that need to be hard-wired into your network, you
                    may need to have additional ethernet cabling running through the new
                    space. If you’re moving into a large building that has a number of
                    floors, you may meet to have structured cabling ran to
                    telecommunications enclosures on each floor and backbone cabling ran
                    between those enclosures and the main equipment room. Our IT Support
                    Technicians help provide planning as well as installation in your
                    office relocation.

                <p>
                    <strong>WiFi deployment –</strong> Preparing a building for WiFi
                    requires more planning than simply placing a few wireless network
                    extenders and routers here and there. We will look at the size of
                    each floor and take into consideration anything that could impede
                    your WiFi signal, including walls and other electrical
                    installations. Then we will carefully plan out a series of WiFi
                    equipment to create a blanket of signal that covers the entire
                    space. Our goal is to make certain you don’t have any spots where
                    wireless connectivity drops or becomes significantly weaker than in
                    other parts of the building.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>VoIP –</strong> If you’re going to use primarily VoIP for
                    your phones, you will need to have a Cat5 ethernet connection near
                    each location where you will have a phone. VoIP phones cannot use
                    standard phone jacks or cable, although you can use one connection
                    for both your phone and your VoIP handset by connecting the two.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Video Conferencing Equipment –</strong> You may need
                    additional cables and equipment installed in any conference room
                    where you plan to do video conferencing. These conference rooms may
                    need video screens, projectors, microphones, speakers, and other
                    equipment. Even if you don’t plan on doing video conferencing, you
                    may still want to have your conference rooms equipped with the
                    capability in case you need it in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Server Rooms –</strong> During a relocation, planning out
                    exactly where your servers, telecommunications enclosures, and your
                    equipment room isn’t something you should evert leave to chance.
                    Everything needs to take into account location in the building, the
                    amount of cabling that will need to be run, the location of where
                    the internet connection from the utility company is located, and
                    other factors. Having the proper IT support team is critical for
                    making these decisions wisely. We carefully work with your team to
                    determine the best locations for these rooms so that your IT
                    infrastructure is thoughtfully considered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Power Outlets –</strong> If you’re moving into an older
                    building, you may be surprised by its lack of power outlets. Today,
                    offices have a lot of equipment that needs to be plugged in,
                    including computers, monitors, printers, servers, routers, backup
                    drives, and much more. Using too many power strips could lead to
                    overloading the circuits and other issues. Part of our IT support
                    during your relocation is to assess power requirements and determine
                    if the building’s existing infrastructure can meet those needs. It’s
                    possible an experienced electrician will need to come in and do a
                    partial or full rewire of the space.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Cooling Requirements –</strong> If you have a larger server
                    room, it’s going to get very hot in there very quickly. Servers put
                    out a lot of heat, so these rooms are going to need to be cooled to
                    the correct temperature and remain at that temperature. Otherwise,
                    your servers may overheat. We will evaluate your planned server
                    setup and the building’s HVAC system to determine if it’s adequate
                    or if you’ll need to upgrade it.
                </p>

                <h2>IT Support While Expanding Your Current Space</h2>

                <p>
                    If you’re expanding into more of your current floor or if you’re
                    moving into additional floors in the same building, you need to take
                    into consideration your current infrastructure and if it’s really
                    sufficient to handle the increased load. In most cases, it’s simply
                    not. You may need additional telecommunications enclosures, more
                    ethernet connections, additional WiFi repeaters, and other support
                    structures in order to expand yet still have the same network access
                    and quality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Expanding can require as much work as moving into a new space,
                    especially if the area you’re expanding into hasn’t been wired for
                    use as an office. This is why having the proper IT support and
                    during any phase of office transition is so vital for your business.
                    You may have to run a good amount of network cable before you can
                    begin using that space, but it’s always best to do so before you
                    move into it. It may be tempting to immediately spread out, but talk
                    to us first so we can help you plan out the best way to expand
                    without losing any of your networking capabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ​Naturally, just as there are reasons why you should move, there are
                    also reasons why you shouldn’t relocate. If your business isn’t
                    stable financially or if your industry is going through a rough
                    patch, it can be a risk. You need to take time and look over your
                    business’s current state as well as the overall industry’s state and
                    the economy before making the decision to relocate. However, if you
                    do decide that now is the right time to relocate, we’re here to make
                    that move go as easily and as smoothly as possible.
                </p>

                <h2>IT Support During A Relocation Is Less Stressful</h2>

                <p>
                    Visual Network Solutions will be there to make sure you hit the ground running. We
                    know that moving to a new location can be the first step in growing
                    your business. You may be expanding the space of your office or
                    manufacturing facility, allowing you to take on more customers or
                    produce more products quickly. You could be moving into a new market
                    that you feel will provide a better foundation from which to expand.
                    You could simply be moving to a newer building or one with better
                    rental fees. No matter what the reason, we want to make sure you can
                    focus on the excitement that the new location brings and not worry
                    about the little annoyances or problems that often come up in a
                    commercial move.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you move to a new location, there are many different
                    opportunities you can take advantage of. Here are a few different
                    reasons why moving locations can be so exciting:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>You have more space –</strong> You can expand your office,
                    adding additional workstations, conference rooms, storage, or any
                    other area you need. This is one of the reasons why you need to
                    carefully consider the location you’re moving to. You want to make
                    certain you can expand to meet the needs you’ll have for the next
                    five to ten years rather than your immediate needs. Otherwise, you
                    may find yourself needing to relocate again in just a few years.
                    This is vital to growing your business, especially if you know you
                    will need to hire additional employees soon and may need to do so
                    again in a few years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Find new customers –</strong> Moving to a new location can
                    mean moving into an area with more potential customers. This can be
                    especially true with companies that deal in sales, whether it’s
                    retail products or services. A new location may better fit your
                    potential audience. You may also be moving out of an area that was a
                    detriment to your business, whether it’s due to a lack of traffic, a
                    high crime rate, or any other issue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Save money –</strong> A new location may come with lower
                    rent or lower utility costs. This can be a great chance to reduce
                    your operating costs. Don’t base your decision on the rent alone,
                    though, since there are other factors to consider. For example,
                    moving into a larger space may come with a higher rent, but if it’s
                    a new building, you may have lower utility costs thanks to better
                    insulation and an energy-efficient HVAC.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Move for other amenities –</strong> In some cases, you may
                    want to move not because you gain more space but because you can
                    expand in other ways. For example, you may want to move to a
                    location that has better parking or that is closer to your major
                    clients. Better access to major highways, a port, or the airport can
                    also benefit your business. Ideally, of course, you’ll move to a
                    location that has these amenities, is the right size, and helps you
                    reduce your monthly operating costs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The building is newer –</strong> Working out of an older
                    building not only impacts your monthly utility cost, but it can also
                    affect your technology. Older buildings have older wiring that may
                    not support your needs. This can result in either working without
                    all of the equipment you need or spending money to update the
                    building’s wiring and cable. Newer buildings, especially when you
                    have the chance to do any upgrades before you move in, don’t have
                    this issue. Newer buildings may also come with a reduced insurance
                    rate, too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Payless taxes –</strong> It’s possible you may be able to
                    move just a short distance yet fall into a new location with lower
                    taxes. Changing counties or cities can put you in an area with a
                    different sales tax. Keep this in mind when considering where you
                    want to relocate your business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Raise operating capital –</strong> If you’re relocating into
                    a rental space and selling the property you’re currently using, the
                    cash you receive from that sale can give you the operating capital
                    you need to expand, reduce your debt, or use for other needs.
                </p>

                <h2>IT Support During A Office Relocation Is Less Challenging</h2>

                <p>
                    Transitioning your internet/phone services and making sure emergency
                    services are up-to-date are, in fact, two of the toughest hurdles to
                    clear. Your new office space might need new access points or an
                    entirely different cabling structure. This is where our experience
                    becomes your biggest asset. We want to manage your transition with
                    no disruption to your operations and no downtime in your services.
                    The goal is for you to move into your new building and immediately
                    be able to begin working again with as little downtime as possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you take advantage of our other services, this can actually make
                    your relocation even easier. When Visual Network Solutions is already managing your
                    data backup, disaster recovery, and VoIP phone systems, moving them
                    to a new location will be much more straightforward. We will be able
                    to quickly set up your hardware, connect it to the cloud, restore
                    your network security, and have your calls directed to the correct
                    handset. We prefer to have 6 to 88 to 12 weeks of relocation
                    planning time to engineer and structure your move, but we have been
                    able to perform a move in less time in the past largely depending on
                    the ability to get outside vendors (cabling, electricians, and
                    Internet Services Providers) to complete installations in the time
                    frame required.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why work with us instead of letting a moving less experienced
                    company move your technology or doing it yourself? We understand how
                    to pack up your technology, move it and set up your equipment
                    without damaging it. Thanks to our experience with IT, we know the
                    best way to set up an office. We’ll work with you to determine the
                    right layout for your new IT center and make certain that you have
                    everything needed. We can even recommend additional hardware and
                    other items that will help improve productivity and that can be
                    installed and set up now so you don’t have to disrupt your daily
                    business later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Obviously, the more time we have for your move, the easier your
                    transition will be. We want to help you create the perfect new
                    location for your business where you have the space and resources
                    needed to grow. Our service area for office relocation reaches
                    beyond our home office in downtown Dallas. We also serve
                    clients in Dallas County, Orange County, Ventura County, and
                    San Bernardino County.

                    One of the advantages that you will get by partnering with Visual Network Solutions
                    to handle your IT Support during a relocation over other commercial
                    moving services is our eye for improvement. There might have been
                    limitations in your old location or services that would have been
                    too expensive to deploy in an established space. Your move will be
                    the perfect opportunity to implement new services and hardware. We
                    want to hear all of your IT needs and what problems you’ve had in
                    your current location to determine if we can eliminate those issues
                    in your new space.

                <h2>IT Support Exposes Risks</h2>

                <p>
                    We will assess your new space and recommend the best methods and
                    practices for your future. This may involve installing new access
                    points, rewiring running new network cables in parts or all of the
                    building, or even creating new spaces by taking down or putting up
                    walls helping the architect and you decide where to put up walls and
                    run proper electrical connections. For example, if you have a number
                    of servers that are always running, now is the perfect time to
                    engineer a room with correct cooling systems for your heat output.
                    We can help you calculate this and select the properly sized HVAC
                    system to meet your needs. stems won’t crash during periods of
                    extreme heat.

                    Moving offices is about more than just packing up your furniture and
                    office equipment. It’s also about thinking about the future of your
                    business rather than the placement of your furniture and equipment.
                    You don’t move locations often, so why not take the time to fully
                    set up your new office in the best way possible? For Visual Network Solutions, a
                    full-service move means looking at the ways your business operates
                    and the ways we can improve your services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Office relocation with us is the perfect time to enhance your
                    systems and set you up for a brighter future. Don’t move in and then
                    try to upgrade the building as you go or when you need it later. We
                    will work with you to upgrade everything now, so even though you may
                    not need all of the extra cabling or access points we add today, it
                    will be there tomorrow when you do.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let us work with you to create the perfect layout, make certain all
                    of the cabling and wiring is where it should be, and maximize your
                    overall use of the space. <a href="/contact-us">Contact us</a> today
