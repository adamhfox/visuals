                <p>
                    Our comprehensive managed service offering includes a
                    state-of-the-art antivirus and intrusion protection system designed
                    to protect your network and data so that your valuable information
                    is kept secure. Antivirus and intrusion software is designed to
                    detect malicious behavior and destroy viruses that can pose a threat
                    to your network. Antivirus and intrusion protection is used to
                    monitor the behavior of your network to detect and report any
                    unauthorized intrusions, including malicious hackers seeking to
                    damage your network and steal your data. Whether you’re dealing with
                    a virus from an employee who fell for a phishing scam or a hacker
                    who is trying to steal your data, you’ll be protected.

                <p>

                    multi-vector security and protection mean you don’t need to purchase
                    a separate firewall, antivirus and intrusion program, and other
                    security measures. It’s all in one package, so there are no
                    compatibility issues. All of your security tools will work
                    effortlessly together with without creating any conflicts or leaving
                    any vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. These tools also
                    seamlessly integrate with the other solutions Visual Network Solutions offers. This
                    type of umbrella protection also makes it easier for you to view
                    your security solutions and understand how each is protecting you.
                    Multiple layers of security is the key and not just relying on one
                    system to protect you. As a part of our MSSP services we offer
                    additional layers of protection for companies as well.

                <h3>The Security Features You Must Have</h3>

                <p>
                    Your company needs to be protected, and that means making use of a
                    number of common security features. However, through
                    <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/">SonicWall</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home">Webroot</a> , there’s
                    nothing basic or simple about the security solutions we implement
                    for you. These solutions are state of the art and are constantly
                    evolving to meet your needs and to provide protection against the
                    newest viruses, malware, and hacking tools. Here are some of the
                    security features you will have available to you through our
                    antivirus solutions and intrusion protection:
                </p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Firewalls –</strong> The next-generation firewall hardware
                    features real-time deep memory inspection to block attacks as they
                    occur. With antivirus and threat protection from both, you’re
                    protected with multiple layers of security. Your data is also
                    encrypted using highly secure encryption methods.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Antivirus Protection –</strong> Of course, no security
                    solution would be complete without some form of virus protection.
                    These security solutions constantly scan for viruses, malware,
                    ransomware, and other malicious programs. When found, they’re
                    quickly dealt with, and you’re provided a report describing the
                    situation.
                </li>

                <p>
                    <strong>DNS Protection –</strong> The Domain Name System is what
                    directs users to the correct location. Unfortunately, DNS was
                    designed and implemented in an age where cyber-terrorism and attacks
                    were unheard of. This has left websites vulnerable to things such as
                    hijacking, cache poisoning, denial of service attacks, and more. DNS
                    protection protects a website from these issues by routing traffic
                    through a cloud-based security solution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>WiFi Security –</strong> As more devices cut the cord and go
                    wireless, more security vulnerabilities appear. WiFi security is a
                    must today. Fortunately, the new 802.11ac and 802.11n technology
                    have made security easier while increasing the range and performance
                    of WiFi.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Mobile Device Management (MDM) –</strong> Along with WiFi,
                    many people are now using mobile devices. Some of these devices may
                    be company-owned, but others may be brought in by employees. All it
                    takes is for one employee smartphone with a virus to infect your
                    entire system. Mobile device security controls access provides
                    security and minimizes these threats. It also protects your servers
                    and mobile devices when employees log in from other WiFi networks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Email Security –</strong> Every email server needs
                    protection, and cloud-based security is the new standard. It
                    protects against phishing and fraud attacks by using real-time
                    threat intelligence to catch malicious emails as they come in.
                    Employees won’t click on these phishing URLs because the email will
                    be scanned and quarantined before it hits their inbox.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Endpoint Protection –</strong> You want your data to be
                    protected from the moment it leaves your server to the minute it
                    reaches the destination device. Capture Client by SonicWall is
                    designed to offer this multiple endpoint protection. It guards
                    against malware and ransomware, encrypts data at both ends, provides
                    monitoring and detailed reports of your system and any attacks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Risk Meters –</strong> Risk meters help you view your
                    system’s current security status, analyze any vulnerabilities, and
                    help you identify security risks. You can also create various
                    what-if scenarios to determine how your security would fare in
                    various attacks. These scenarios can highlight where you need to
                    focus your efforts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to these tools, it’s also important that your employees
                    have the training and knowledge needed to deal with any threat that
                    does make it through your security.
                    <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home">Webroot</a> offers
                    security awareness training to do just that. It teaches your team
                    about cybersecurity, compliance, and best practices. They will learn
                    how to recognize phishing and other scams, identify malware, and
                    understand the process for reporting potential threats and attacks.
                    This training can greatly reduce your risk of cyber-attack since the
                    largest percentage of network breaches actually come from user
                    error. By making this training a part of your onboarding process,
                    you can give your employees the education needed to protect
                    themselves and your company.

                <h2>What is a Managed Services Security Provider (MSSP)?</h2>

                <p>
                    A managed services security provider offers outsourced monitoring
                    and management of your security systems. Services commonly include
                    firewalls, intrusion detection, virtual private network,
                    vulnerability scanning, and anti-viral services. MSSPs use security
                    operation centers (either from their facility or a data center) to
                    provide 24/7 services designed to reduce the number of security
                    personnel needed for your company.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Companies with sensitive information that needs to be kept secure
                    will typically choose to work with an MSSP. There are many benefits
                    to using a managed services security provider:
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can focus on doing the work that only you can do. No one else
                    knows your business like you do, and there are tasks that only you
                    can handle. With an MSSP as your partner, you can let the experts
                    focus on keeping your network secure while you focus on running and
                    growing the business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    MSSP solutions are scalable. These services are cloud-based, which
                    means adding or removing them is simple. If your company expands,
                    your security services can likewise expand to meet those needs. When
                    you need to pull back a bit, that’s also an option. Because
                    everything is done as licenses through the cloud, there are no
                    copies of software going unused or hardware to store.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You save money by paying one price for your security solutions.
                    Again, if you were to hire an in-house team, you would have to pay
                    salary and benefits, purchase equipment for them to use, allocate
                    facility space for them to work, and more. The MSSP handles all of
                    these costs so you don’t have to budget for them. Instead, you

                    necessary to protect your data.

                <h3>We Monitor Your System 24/7</h3>

                <p>
                    One of our primary missions is to always defend the integrity of the
                    functions of your business, and 24/7 security monitoring is one of
                    our best tools for staying on guard. If you’re infiltrated by a
                    malicious program, even if you find and deal with it quickly, it may
                    still have time to do damage to your network or transmit some of
                    your sensitive data elsewhere. We monitor your entire network so any
                    such intrusion can be quickly discovered and malicious programs are
                    blocked. We also watch for suspicious activities such as the
                    activation of old accounts, unusual login times, or accounts trying
                    to repeatedly access restricted data. Sometimes these are actually
                    employees with no malicious intent, but it’s always best to confirm
                    this rather than leave your system open to attack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That’s because even when an issue isn’t malicious, it still needs to
                    be flagged and investigated. These unusual behaviors could be
                    something as minor as an update that causes a small incompatibility
                    issue, but that issue could still lead to problems or create
                    security vulnerabilities that leave you open to attack. These small
                    issues need to be resolved just as quickly as bigger problems, so
                    they don’t grow to become major threats. These small issues can also
                    build upon each other, resulting in huge security vulnerabilities
                    down the line. Don’t let any type of issue go uninvestigated. Even
                    the smallest problem can become something much worse if you give it
                    time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When an employee account logs in late at night or early in the
                    morning, it could simply be that employee doing some work at an odd
                    hour. However, it could just as easily be a compromised account.
                    Companies that don’t have 24/7 security monitoring may never know
                    that the account was logged in or what was done unless they have a
                    reason to check the logs. If the compromised account is carefully
                    used, it could be weeks or even months before you realize the
                    account is being used to steal data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our 24/7 monitoring and support service ensures that you’re never
                    left unaware of what’s going on with your technology. By dealing
                    with malicious programs and attacks as soon as they happen, you can
                    rest easy knowing that your data is safe. By monitoring how your IT
                    resources are being used and investigating areas that aren’t
                    operating as they should be, we can close any security
                    vulnerabilities while also improving your efficiency and
                    effectiveness. This also helps us identify tools that will need to
                    be replaced or upgraded soon so you can schedule this process rather
                    than waiting until the tool fails and leaves you in an unexpected
                    lurch.
